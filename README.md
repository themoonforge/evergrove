## About Evergrove
ðŸŒŸ *Evergrove* is our entry for Ludum Dare 56! ðŸŒŸ We wanted to take this opportunity to test out some features of the Godot engine that weâ€™re not yet familiar with, particularly regarding pathfinding, AI interactions, and the bustling factor in games. The best part? The game is now available as a browser game on [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56/evergrove) and [itch.io](https://pumpkinchariot.itch.io/evergrove)!

Please note that our source code is a bit chaotic due to the jamâ€™s constraints. However, we are actively gathering ideas for improvements and are excited to continue developing the game in the future!

## The Game
In *Evergrove*, you take control of the environment and shape the fate of a colony of dwarves as they dig deeper into a vast, procedurally generated underground world. Your role is to direct the discovery of vital resources and strategically place essential hubs that keep the colony functioning and growing.

The dwarves mine, build, and expand, but itâ€™s up to you to ensure they have the right infrastructure to survive. From food stations to rest hubs, youâ€™ll decide where and when to spawn key facilities, ensuring the colonyâ€™s growth doesnâ€™t outpace its resources. Every decision you make can either lead the dwarves to prosperity or plunge them into disaster.

Explore, gather, and build in a constantly shifting underground world, where careful planning and strategic hub placement are the keys to success.

## Controls
**PLEASE NOTE:** There may be some lag when starting the game or switching between layers because the world is procedurally generated, so thereâ€™s no need to worry!
